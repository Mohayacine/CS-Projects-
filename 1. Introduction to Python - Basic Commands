# 1. Introduction to Python - Basic Commands (4/03)
# -----------------------------------------------
# We'll show how to: print messages, assign variables, perform math,
# and get input from the user. Each line has a comment explaining its purpose.

# Print a welcome message so the user knows the program started
print("Welcome to Python Basics!")  # using print() to display text on screen

# Create variables to store different types of data
# 'a' holds an integer because we may use whole numbers in calculations
a = 5  # integer variable
description = "Number of items"  # string variable that describes data

# 'b' holds a decimal value to show floats can store fractional numbers
b = 3.2  # float variable

# We can combine variables and operators for calculations
# Here we add 'a' and 'b' so we can demonstrate addition
sum_result = a + b  # add integer and float, result is float
print("Sum of a and b is:", sum_result)  # show addition result

# Subtraction example: useful to show difference between two values
difference = a - b  # subtract float from integer
print("Difference of a and b is:", difference)  # show subtraction result

# Multiplication example: multiplies two numbers for scaling
product = a * b  # multiply integer and float
print("Product of a and b is:", product)  # show multiplication result

# Division example: divides one number by another for ratios
quotient = a / b  # divide a by b, result is float
print("Quotient of a / b is:", quotient)  # show division result
